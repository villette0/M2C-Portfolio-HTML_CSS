# Villette Comfort Portfolio

## Website Description

A portfolio website that gives samples of my, Villette Comfort's, coding abilities through various projects.

## Challenge Description

This project encompassed creating a website without starter code.  The portfolio includes spaces to showcase samples of work along with a short biography and contact links. There is a responsive layout with a grid that has the first project as the largest shown. Internal links bring the user to designated sections and external links navigate to completed projects. 

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria 

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
